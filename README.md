<h1>Pancreatic Cancer Biomarkers Identification</h1>


<p>Pancreatic cancer is right now the forth largest cause of cancer-related deaths. Within 2030 it'll be at second place just behind lung cancer as it's common for both male and female. Early diagnosis is one good solution for pancreatic cancer patients. This repository contains all the necessary files and codes for identification of progonstic biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. It may get updated in future depending on more advanced researches.</p>


<h2><b>Getting Started:</b></h2>


<p>To use the codes and relevent files, first we need some datasets and some tools in which you can run these codes. <a href="#DataCollection"><b>Data Collection Section</b></a> describes from where data can be collected &amp; <b>Install Section</b> describes where to get the desired tools. Finally, <b>Working Process Section</b> describes through which sequence the work has been done.</p>
